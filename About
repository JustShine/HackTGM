Inspiration

World of Games! Codding, eat, sleep, repeat...


What it does

Our project consists of placing treasures located on a 4x4 map by a person from the PC, using the terminal and on the other side, the player who has the watch should find as many treasures as he can. He has five possibilities to guess where they are located on the map.


How we built it

We used arduino.c programming language and as components we used:
2 bluetooth devices
1 nano
1 UNO R3
OLED display
4x4 buttons matrix
wires and cables
battery


Challenges we ran into

Making bluetooth devices transmitting information between two Arduino boards and making master-slave with them.


Accomplishments that we're proud of

Making the device working as we planned.


What we learned

We learned how to work in teams and a lot of stuff based on arduino.c programming language.


What's next for 'Watch' Out for the Treasure

Making a project bigger than that, like a smartwatch.
